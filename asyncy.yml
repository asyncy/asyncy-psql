  PGHOST:

  PGPASSWORD:
    help: behaves the same as the password connection parameter. Use of this environment variable is not recommended for security reasons, as some operating systems allow non-root users to see process environment variables via ps; instead consider using the ~/.pgpass file (see Section 31.14).
